# tachyon-cli-scripts
Various Particle.IO tachyon scripts

## Bash Aliases
Coming soon. The goal is to remove a bunch of the unique commands from the Tachyon and provide a unified interface. Probably through single script that can be symlinked and self-identifies based on it's name and does the needful. Keeps all the code in one file but provides clean short commands. 

## tachyon-info-dump.sh

This was built with the help of The Chatmeister. I would probably ask for their help to make changes. 

This dumps a whole bunch of information about a device into indivisual files or sends it back over STDIN. It also includes some performance benchmarks.
